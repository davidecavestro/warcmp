Warcmp is a tool that 1. expands two WebArchives 2. expands their jars 3. launches jmeld (a great visual diff tool) on the expanded dirs. Nothing more, nothing less.
By default every jar within the war is decompressed so that given a jar file foo.jar in WEB-INF/lib you will get the following structure
++++
<pre>
WEB-INF/lib
|-- foo.jar
|-- foo.jar.inflated
|   |-- com
|   |   |-- acme
</pre>
++++

Usage
-----
./gradlew -Pwar1=/path/to/war1.war -Pwar2=/path/to/war2.war

Optional switches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* +`-Pnojars`+ disables jar contents extraction

* +`-Pnogui`+  disables jmeld launch
