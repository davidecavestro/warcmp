Warcmp is a tool that 1. expands two WebArchives 2. expands their jars 3. launches jmeld (a great visual diff tool) on the expanded dirs. Nothing more, nothing less.

Usage
-----
./gradlew -Pwar1=/path/to/war1.war -Pwar2=/path/to/war2.war

Optional switches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* "-Pnojars" disables jar contents extraction

* "-Pnogui"  disables jmeld launch
